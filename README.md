# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
Overview
This project demonstrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an optimization algorithm inspired by the swarming behavior of birds and fish. The visualization shows how particles explore the search space and converge towards an optimal solution over time.

How PSO Works
PSO is a population-based optimization technique where particles adjust their positions based on:
Their own best-known position (personal best – pbest).
The best-known position found by the swarm (global best – gbest).
Each particle's movement is influenced by inertia, personal experience, and social learning from the swarm. The algorithm iteratively updates particle velocities and positions to minimize the given objective function.
